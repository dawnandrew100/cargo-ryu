# cargo-ryu

A minimal script to enable Cargo support in the [Ryugod](https://www.ryugod.com) online Rust environment.

## Steps

1. Select **Rust** as the language on the Ryugod website.
2. Copy the `main.sh` script into the Ryugod editor or import it.
3. Click the **“Send to Terminal”** button to execute the script.
4. Run `cargo run` in the terminal to verify that everything is working correctly.
5. Use `vim` or any terminal commands to edit and manage your project files.

This setup provides a basic working Rust project structure so you can use `cargo` commands inside Ryugod.
